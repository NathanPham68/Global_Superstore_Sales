## I. Introduction
### üìñ **What is the purpose of this project?**

This project centers on building a Power BI dashboard using the Global Superstore Sales dataset, which includes information on orders, sales representatives and product returns. Its primary goal is to provide senior managers with actionable insights to assess performance, identify growth opportunities, focus on strategic products, and make informed decisions that enhance revenue and Return on Investment (ROI).

### ‚ùì **Business Questions:**

‚úîÔ∏è How is Superstore currently performing?

‚úîÔ∏è Which markets offer the best opportunities for expansion to drive revenue and ROI?

‚úîÔ∏è What products should be prioritized for strategic growth?

### üë§ **Who is this project for?**

‚úîÔ∏è Data and business analysts looking for actionable insights.

‚úîÔ∏è Marketing and sales teams focusing on product performance and market development.

‚úîÔ∏è Route-to-market teams aiming to enhance distribution efficiency and market penetration.

### üéØ **Project Outcome:**

- Revenue saw strong growth, but profit margins stayed flat, suggesting increased costs and minimal efficiency improvements.  
- Canada stood out as a high-margin market (28%) despite generating lower revenue, while Africa and EMEA had the highest YoY growth, signaling strong expansion potential.  
- Oceania and Africa led in acquiring new customers, though most revenue continued to come from loyal repeat buyers.  
- The Technology category drove both revenue and profit growth, though high return rates for specific SKUs (e.g., Cisco, Motorola) affected margins.  
- Products like Copiers delivered the highest profit per unit, whereas low-performing items (e.g., Supplies, Furnishings) diluted overall profitability.

By aligning regional and product strategies, senior managers can **scale in high-margin markets**, **invest in scalable profitable categories**, and **optimize acquisition and return management**, driving **sustainable long-term growth**.

### üìÇ **Introduction to Dataset**

* Total profit margin is moderate and stable across years, but has not improved significantly‚Äîindicating increased costs or operational inefficiencies.

* Q4 consistently shows the highest revenue and order quantity, suggesting strong seasonal demand.

* Returning customers dominate total revenue, while new customer acquisition is limited to certain regions like Oceania and Africa.

### 3. Market

* Canada leads with the highest profit margin (26.62%) and 0% return rate, making it the most profitable and efficient market.

* EMEA shows lowest profit margin (5.45%), mainly due to extreme negative margins in specific countries.

* If underperforming countries are removed, EMEA‚Äôs adjusted margin reaches 23.89%, second only to Canada.

### 4. Product

## IV. Insights & Recommendations

### Insights

The analysis revealed several key patterns in sales and operations:

* Top-performing regions and customer segments significantly contribute to overall revenue, while certain markets underperform consistently.

* Profitability is not directly tied to sales volume ‚Äî some high-sales categories have low or even negative profit margins.

* Returns are concentrated in specific product categories and regions, indicating potential quality or service issues.

* Sales trends fluctuate seasonally, and specific months consistently outperform others, suggesting opportunities for targeted promotions.

* Sales representatives' performance varies widely by region, with some outperforming peers in similar conditions.

### Recommendations

* Refocus marketing and sales efforts on high-margin products and profitable customer segments to maximize ROI.

* Investigate root causes of high return rates in key categories and implement corrective actions such as product quality reviews or better customer education.

* Optimize inventory and staffing based on seasonal trends to improve efficiency and responsiveness.
