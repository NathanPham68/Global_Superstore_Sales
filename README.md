## I. Introduction
### 📖 **What is the purpose of this project?**

This project centers on building a Power BI dashboard using the Global Superstore Sales dataset, which includes information on orders, sales representatives and product returns. Its primary goal is to provide senior managers with actionable insights to assess performance, identify growth opportunities, focus on strategic products, and make informed decisions that enhance revenue and Return on Investment (ROI).

### ❓ **Business Questions:**

✔️ How is Superstore currently performing?

✔️ Which markets offer the best opportunities for expansion to drive revenue and ROI?

✔️ What products should be prioritized for strategic growth?

### 👤 **Who is this project for?**

✔️ Data and business analysts looking for actionable insights.

✔️ Marketing and sales teams focusing on product performance and market development.

✔️ Route-to-market teams aiming to enhance distribution efficiency and market penetration.

### 🎯 **Project Outcome:**

- Revenue saw strong growth, but profit margins stayed flat, suggesting increased costs and minimal efficiency improvements.  
- Canada stood out as a high-margin market (28%) despite generating lower revenue, while Africa and EMEA had the highest YoY growth, signaling strong expansion potential.  
- Oceania and Africa led in acquiring new customers, though most revenue continued to come from loyal repeat buyers.  
- The Technology category drove both revenue and profit growth, though high return rates for specific SKUs (e.g., Cisco, Motorola) affected margins.  
- Products like Copiers delivered the highest profit per unit, whereas low-performing items (e.g., Supplies, Furnishings) diluted overall profitability.

By aligning regional and product strategies, senior managers can **scale in high-margin markets**, **invest in scalable profitable categories**, and **optimize acquisition and return management**, driving **sustainable long-term growth**.

### 📂 **Introduction to Dataset**

* Total profit margin is moderate and stable across years, but has not improved significantly—indicating increased costs or operational inefficiencies.

* Q4 consistently shows the highest revenue and order quantity, suggesting strong seasonal demand.

👉🏻 Leverage Q4 seasonal peaks through targeted marketing campaigns, bundled offers, and stock optimization.

* Returning customers dominate total revenue, while new customer acquisition is limited to certain regions like Oceania and Africa.

👉🏻 Develop regional acquisition strategies with tailored product mixes to penetrate markets where new customer growth is low.

### 3. Market

<img width="1333" height="823" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99625ba4-d2bb-4bb5-bf17-fbbec3dab6de" />

* Canada leads with the highest profit margin (26.62%) and 0% return rate, making it the most profitable and efficient market.

* EMEA shows lowest profit margin (5.45%), mainly due to extreme negative margins in specific countries.

* Other markets show moderate performance, with certain high-growth potential areas still underdeveloped.

* **Markets Recommended for Expansion:** Canada, High-Performing Countries in EMEA, High-Growth Emerging Markets in APAC & LATAM

* Recommended Strategies by Market Type
  - **Mature & Highly Profitable Markets** (e.g., Canada)
    
    - Double down on customer loyalty programs to retain high-value customers.

    - Introduce premium product lines and bundled offers to increase Average Order Value (AOV).

    - Maintain operational excellence to sustain the low return rate.

  -  **Selective Expansion Markets** (Profitable countries in EMEA, parts of APAC/LATAM)
    
    - Localized Product Strategy: Adapt product assortments to local preferences.
    
    - Targeted Marketing: Use regional data to run culturally relevant campaigns.
    
    - Strategic Partnerships: Work with local distributors to reduce market entry risks.

  -  **Underperforming or Loss-Making Markets**

    - Conduct deep profitability audits to identify structural issues (pricing, logistics, product fit).
    
    - Reduce or exit markets with persistently negative margins unless there is a clear turnaround plan.
    
    - Shift focus to digital sales channels to lower operational costs and test market responsiveness.

### 4. Product

* Paper is the most profitable sub-category (23.93% profit margin).

* Other high-margin products include: Labels (20.19%), Envelopes (17.05%), Accessories (16.98%), Copiers (16.77%), Binders (16.41%).

👉🏻 Focus sales and promotional efforts on high-margin categories to boost total profitability.

* Categories like Tables, Machines, Supplies, Chairs have significantly lower margins.

👉🏻 Review pricing and sourcing strategies for low-margin products; consider discontinuation or redesign for underperforming SKUs.

### 5. Net sales

* Technology leads in revenue, but faces higher return rates, especially with brands like Cisco and Motorola.

* Top-selling products (e.g., Canon imageCLASS) contribute significantly to profit.

👉🏻 Expand marketing around top-selling, high-profit products to strengthen their market share.

* Some SKUs such as Cubify CubeX 3D Printers are consistently unprofitable.

👉🏻 Discontinue or phase out chronically unprofitable SKUs, reallocating shelf space and marketing spend toward proven performers.

## IV. Insights & Recommendations

### Insights

The analysis revealed several key patterns in sales and operations:

* Top-performing regions and customer segments significantly contribute to overall revenue, while certain markets underperform consistently.

* Returns are concentrated in specific product categories and regions, indicating potential quality or service issues.

* Sales trends fluctuate seasonally, and specific months consistently outperform others, suggesting opportunities for targeted promotions.

* Sales representatives' performance varies widely by region, with some outperforming peers in similar conditions.

### Recommendations

* Refocus marketing and sales efforts on high-margin products and profitable customer segments to maximize ROI.

* Investigate root causes of high return rates in key categories and implement corrective actions such as product quality reviews or better customer education.

* Optimize inventory and staffing based on seasonal trends to improve efficiency and responsiveness.

* Launch training or support programs for underperforming sales reps to enhance overall team performance.

* Explore market expansion in regions with steady growth potential and proven customer demand.
