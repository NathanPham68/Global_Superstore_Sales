## I. Introduction
### 1. Introduction to Dataset
This project aims to develop a comprehensive business intelligence dashboard for a global retail company using three core datasets.
The dashboard empowers senior managers to gain a clear view of overall sales performance, profit trends, customer behavior, product performance, and return rates — enabling data-driven decisions for market expansion and strategic product focus.
* Consists of 3 data tables:
  - Table 1: Orders: Fact order
  - Table 2: People: Information of Sales person
  - Table 3: Returns: Information of Returned orders

## IV. Insights
1) Business Overview

・Total sales: $12.64M, Total profit: $1.47M

→ Profit margin is around 11.6%, which is not very high

=> Profitability should be closely monitored.

・Return rate: 2.29%, which is an acceptable level for global sales.

2) Market Region Analysis

・APAC, EU, LATAM, and EMEA are the four main regions, accounting for the majority of sales.

・United state is the country with the largest number of orders. 

3) Product Category Analysis

・Technology accounts for the highest sales (37.53%) → It is the core product category.

・Office Supplies and Furniture also contribute significantly, though to a lesser extent.
However, some technology products are heavily unprofitable (e.g., Cubby Cubex 3D) → these should be reviewed for potential removal or strategic adjustment.

4) Top Products and Customers

・Canon ImageCLASS and Cisco Smart Phone are the most profitable products.

・Top 5 customers generate consistent profits (from $7.4k to $8.6k) → These are VIP customers who require special attention.

5) Growth Trends

・Sales and profits showed positive growth year-over-year from 2011 to 2014, especially strong starting in 2013 → A positive trend.

6) Logistics

・Average delivery time: 3.97 days

・Returned orders are not negligible (1,172 orders) → Needs further investigation (product quality? delayed delivery?)

## V. Recommendations
1) Focus on High-Potential Markets

・Strengthen presence in APAC and EU, which already show strong sales and have further potential.

・Prioritize expansion in EMEA, as it holds a significant market share but hasn't seen explosive growth yet.

2) Optimize Product Portfolio

・Continue investing in high-margin technology products.

・Review and remove or improve loss-making products (e.g., Cubby Cubex 3D).

・Consider upselling / cross-selling Office Supplies and Furniture to technology customers.

3) Nurture VIP Customers

・Design special loyalty programs for high-profit customers (e.g., Bill Eplett, Hunter Lopez, etc.).

・Provide faster delivery and better after-sales support for this customer segment.

4) Improve Logistics and Return Control

・Conduct deeper analysis into the reasons for product returns to improve product quality or service.

・Enhance order tracking and ensure more accurate delivery commitments.
